Project 1
Project Description:

This project aims to analyze the relationship between employment dynamics and dividend payouts and their impact on the stock market performance of companies. The project will seek to answer whether changes in employment dynamics, such as layoffs or hiring sprees, significantly impact companies' dividend payout decisions and whether such decisions subsequently affect the performance of their stock prices.

The project will use a mixed-methods approach involving quantitative and qualitative data analysis. The quantitative analysis will include collecting and analyzing data on the employment dynamics, dividend payouts, and stock market performance of a sample of companies from various industries. The qualitative analysis will involve interviews with industry experts to gain insights into the factors influencing companies' decisions on employment and dividend payouts.

Research questions:
How does a company's employment history (such as employee growth, turnover rate, and average tenure) correlate with its dividend payout patterns in the stock market over a specific period?
Are companies more likely to decrease or increase their dividend payouts following a change in employment dynamics?
To what extent do company dividend pay changes affect their stock market performance? Are companies with higher dividend payouts more likely to experience positive stock price movements, or is there no significant relationship between the two variables?
What key factors influence companies' decisions on employment and dividend payouts?
